# Purr Browser Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/purrject/purr-browser-extension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/purrject/purr-browser-extension)

This is the part of Purr responsible for providing a communication channel between the client executable and the JS frontend.

## Installation
The extension is available from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/purr/kbobleenjfbacnajgodnjbbnekmocooh) and from the [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/purr/).

## Usage
The extension is not designed for standalone usage, rather to be called from the browser using the frontend library.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies. You can also run `npm test` to run all the tests. There are other development-related commands available in the form of gulp tasks, type `npm gulp` to list all of them.
